# DESCRIPTION
This QR-code-component is a sample project l took from Frontend mentor. lt does not really do much, just used HTML as the skeleton and CSS to add the beautiful flesh to it.

# MY MOTIVATION (PRACTICE MAKES ONE PERFECT).
 Though this project may look simple, it did really make me do a bit of research concerning things l thought l already knew. At the end, l am pround that l managed to do it myself and hoping to hop onto other interesting projects.
